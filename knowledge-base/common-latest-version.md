## Description
The solution demonstrates two different approaches to finding which is the latest version of the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX controls.

## Solution
You can use two approaches to see which is the latest version:

* Review the [Release History page for Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-ajax/release-history). The latest release is always on top.

* Make sure you have installed the [Telerik Visual Studio extension]({%slug introduction/radcontrols-for-asp.net-ajax-fundamentals/integration-with-visual-studio/visual-studio-extensions/overview%}) in your Visual Studio since they will automatically notify you about new UI for ASP.NET AJAX versions. For more information, review the [Download New Version article]({%slug introduction/radcontrols-for-asp.net-ajax-fundamentals/integration-with-visual-studio/visual-studio-extensions/automatic-latest-version-retrieval%})
