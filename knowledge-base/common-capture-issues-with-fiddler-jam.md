## What is Fiddler Jam

[Fiddler Jam](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler-jam) is designed for support teams to spend less time instructing end-users by delivering a solution that helps you troubleshoot remote issues quickly, easily, and securely. The traditional back-and-forth is eliminated, creating a more harmonious experience that exceeds your userâ€™s expectations.

### How it works

End-users share the full context (network logs, browser console logs, and screenshots of each action) via a Chrome extension instead of manually attaching to an email or a support ticket. Your support team analyzes the logs for troubleshooting. If needed, developers debug further by inspecting the logs in the [Fiddler Jam Portal](https://jam.getfiddler.com/) or with [Fiddler Everywhere](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-everywhere).

### Security

Fiddler Jam is a Chrome extension tool that can capture the ongoing tab activity and generate links with the captured activity logs. With such functionality, a particular set of security is added as functionality to Fiddler Jam to protect its users' privacy and allow you to share logs with some information being entirely stripped. You can find more information on the topic in [Fiddler Jam Secuirty](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-jam/security).

## Installing Fiddler Jam
