## Description
Learn how to delete the temporary files generated by the Telerik RadPersistenceFramework control in the App_Data folder automatically. Of course, you can delete them manually since they are identified with the ID of the session, but if the user closes the browser without pressing the end of session button, the file remains generated.

## Solution
RadPersistenceManager does not have built-in functionality to reset its saved settings, but I can suggest you several possible approaches to achieve such a result:

* Implement a reset logic like demonstrated: [PersistenceFramework Overview demo](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/persistence-framework/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx)
* Reset the state of the control and then save the state again: [Reset RadGrid state]({%slug grid-reset-state%})
* Delete manually the saved state files inside the ~/App_Data using the [System.IO.Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.directory.getfiles?view=netframework-4.8) and [System.IO.File](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file?view=net-6.0) API
* Implement a custom Storage provider, in which you can store the saved setting in the desired location (in a database or in a cookie) and delete/change them as per your application needs: [Custom Storage Provider]({%slug persistenceframework/functionality/-custom-storage-provider%}).
