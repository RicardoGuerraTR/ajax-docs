# Client-side Programming Overview



This article introduces the RadTreeList client object with its properties, methods and events along with the client-side API of its child objects.

## RadTreeList client object

To get reference of the RadTreeList client-side object, you can use one of the following approaches:

* Using the **$find(id)** method (shortcut for the findComponent() method) of the ASP.NET AJAX framework:

````JavaScript
<telerik:RadCodeBlock ID="RadCodeBlock1" runat="server">
	<script type="text/javascript">
		function GetTreeList() {
			var treelist = $find("<%= RadTreeList1.ClientID %>");
		}
	</script>
</telerik:RadCodeBlock>
````



* Subscribing for the **OnTreeListCreated** client-side event of the control. In its handler the sender argument references the **RadTreeList** client object:

````JavaScript
<script type="text/javascript">
	var treeList = null;
	function TreeListCreated(sender, eventArgs) {
		treeList = sender;
	}
</script>
<telerik:RadTreeList RenderMode="Lightweight" ID="RadTreeList1" runat="server">
	<ClientSettings>
		<ClientEvents OnTreeListCreated="TreeListCreated" />
	</ClientSettings>
</telerik:RadTreeList>
````

| **set_selectedIndexes()** |Property which sets the selected indexes for RadTreeList.|
| **get_selectedItems()** |Property which returns the collection of all selected items of RadTreeList.|
| **get_clientSettings()** |Property which returns client-side objects which represent the RadTreeList client settings.|
| **get_clientDataKeyNames()** |Property which gets a collection of the client data key names.|
| **get_currentPageIndex()** |Property which returns the current page index of the treelist.|
| **set_currentPageIndex()** |Property which sets the current page index by firing a Page command.|

### Client-side Methods

**RadTreeList** provides the following client-side methods:


>caption  

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **getCellByColumnUniqueName(rowObject, uniqueName)** |Property which returns the table cell of the TreeList by a given item(row) and column unique name|
| **getColumnByUniqueName(uniqueName)** |Property which gets the client side object for the column by a given unique name.|
| **getContainerItem(element)** |Property which receives a DOM element as an argument and returns a reference to the TreeListItem object which contains it.|
| **getItem(rowIdIndex)** |Property which returns the client-side TreeList item.|
| **selectItem(item)** |The item corresponding to the treelist item passed as an argument will be selected.|
| **deselectItem(item)** |The item corresponding to the treelist item passed as an argument will be deselected.|
| **selectAllItems()** |Method which selects all items in the RadTreeList.|
| **deselectAllItems()** |Method which deselects all items in the RadTreeList.|
| **page(command)** |Method which fires a page command with the specified command argument (Next, Prev, First, Last).|
| **fireCommand(commandName, commandArgument)** |Method which triggers specific command for the RadTreeList when executed. The method is called for the RadTreeList client instance. The method arguments are the command which will be processed and its corresponding arguments.|

### Client-side Events

| **OnColumnResizing** |This event is fired before the treelist column is resized.|
| **OnColumnResized** |This event is fired after the treelist column is resized.|
