## Server Methods


>caption Server methods that invoke a certain action of the control

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Show** |When called the RadNotification will be shown on the client once the page is loaded (or the AJAX request is receieved). It does not require that the notification is updated in the partial postback in order to work (if you change some properties in an AJAX request, however, you need to include the control in the request).The Show() method has one override - optionally it can take a string message that will be shown in the notification once. This message is not persisted in the viewstate and the control will maintain its old value in case of a subsequent postback/AJAX request. More information can be found in [this online demo](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/notification/examples/servershowwithnewtext/defaultcs.aspx). Note that this string ultimately passes through JavaScript, therefore it must be escaped properly, e.g. apostrophes will throw an error, because they are string delimiters in this programming language.|
