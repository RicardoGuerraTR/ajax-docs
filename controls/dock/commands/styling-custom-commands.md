# Styling Custom Commands


Every [skin]({%slug dock/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) provides a default icon that appears in the **RadDock** title bar for custom commands. Typically, however, you will want to change this icon to a more meaningful image.

To modify the image that appears as a custom command's icon, you need to follow these steps:

1. Define a CSS class that identifies a background image to represent the custom command. You can use a separate CSS file and link to it, or you can define the CSS class in the <head> tag of the Web page. The CSS class you define is applied to the `<a>` element for the command on the rendered Web page.

````CSS
.MyCustomStyle
{
    width: 15px !important;
    background: url(../MyImages/CustomCommand.gif) !important;
}
````

1. Set the **CssClass** property of the command to your new CSS class:

````XML
<telerik:RadDock runat="server" id="RadDock1" text="Custom Command">  
    <Commands>    
        <telerik:DockCommand 
            CssClass="MyCustomStyle"        
            Name="doSomething"        
            OnClientCommand="HandleDoSomething" />    
        <telerik:DockExpandCollapseCommand />  
    </Commands>
</telerik:RadDock>
````

>tip If the custom command has two states (when using Telerik.Web.UI.DockToggleCommand), set the **AlternateCssClass** property of the command to supply an image for the alternate state.
