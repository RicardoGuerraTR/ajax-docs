# Structure



## 

The structure of the **RadPanelBar** (Accordion) control is as follows:

![PanelBar Structure](images/panelbar_structure.png)

The panel bar consists of a hierarchy of items. The items on one level are exposed when the parent item on the previous level is expanded. Each item is represented by a **RadPanelItem** instance.

* At the top level are the **root items**. These items are always visible. They are available using the **Items** property of the panel bar (**RadPanelBar.Items**).

* Each root item may have, nested within it, a set of child items. Children of the root items are considered **level 1 items**. They are available using the **Items** property of the root item (**RadPanelItem.Items**)

* Child items may have, nested within them, their own sets of child items. Children of level 1 items are considered **level 2 items**; children of level 2 items are considered **level 3 items**; and so on.

One item in the panel bar can be designated as the Selected item. This is the last item that the user clicks, and has a distinct appearance from the other items at its level.

If the items are created at design time, the hierarchy is reflected in the ASP.NET declaration of the panel bar:

````ASPNET

	</Items>
