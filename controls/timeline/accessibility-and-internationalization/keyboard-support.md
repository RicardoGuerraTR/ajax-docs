>caption Focus

When the `Navigatable` property of the timeline is set to *'true'* as well as the following JavaScript code is set, you can focus the timeline with the Alt+W shortcut:

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadTimeline runat="server" ID="RadTimeline1" AlternatingMode="true" CollapsibleEvents="true" Orientation="Vertical" Navigatable="true">
<script>
	var $ = $telerik.$;
	$(document.body).keydown(function (e) {
		if (e.altKey && e.keyCode == 87) {
			$(".k-card:first").focus();
		}
	});
</script>
````

As result Alt + W focuses the timeline first card.
