# Keyboard support

## 

You can enable keyboard navigation in the **RadLightBox** control by setting the **ClientSettings.AllowKeyboardNavigation** property to **True** (its default value is **False**). Currently the following features are supported:

**Access Keys**: An access key is a key combination (e.g. Ctrl+Y) that lets the user move focus to the LightBox control and subsequently use the Left and Rigth arrow keys for navigation. The access key is defined using the **AccessKey** property. For example, setting the **AccessKey** property to "Y" enables users to move focus to the LightBox by typing Ctrl+Y.

	<telerik:RadLightBox RenderMode="Lightweight" ID="RadLightBox1" runat="server" AccessKey="Y">
