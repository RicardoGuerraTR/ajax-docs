# Toggle Handle



## Toggle Handle

As of **Q3 2013** the **RadMenu** features a new functionality aiming to improve its usability and user experience under mobile devices. This new functionality is enabled through the **ShowToggleHandle** property of the control, which is **false** by default. Once enabled (by setting the aforementioned property to **True**) a **Toggle Handle** will appear beside the text or image of the the **RadMenuItem**. Once clicked or touched the **Toggle Handle** will show or hide the child items of the corresponding item to which it belongs. It is also worth mentioning that this **Toggle Handle** will be shown only when the menu item has children or when its **ExpandMode** is set to **WebService**.

Due to the nature of the **RadMenu** and its current implementation, there were a few challenges that we needed to overcome when designing a unified behavior for both a traditional desktop environment and a touch-enabled one. By default, the child menu items are shown once their parent item is hovered. While such a scenario is applicable in traditional mouse-centric environments, it introduces problems on touch-enabled devices when the parent items have the **NavitageUrl** set or have to execute some action like server-side event upon click or touch.

However, when you enable the **Toggle Handle**, these problems are solved. For example, once you click or touch the **Toggle Handle**, it will only show or hide the children of the particular item without executing any action (navigation or sever event execution).

The event order when the **Toggle Handle** is clicked or touched is the same as the one when the menu item is hovered. First the **OnClientItemOpening** is fired followed by **OnClientItemOpened** when the menu item is closed or **OnClientItemClosing** followed by **OnClientItemClosed** when the menu item is opened.
